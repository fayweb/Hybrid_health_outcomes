Laboratory Development & Discovery & Can immune genes predict infection costs? & DISC-1 & Linear regression (PC1, PC2 → weight loss) & Significant but modest prediction & n = 136 & R² = 0.106*** \\ 
Laboratory Development & Optimization & Can machine learning improve prediction? & DISC-2 & Random forest (19 genes → weight loss) & Substantial improvement achieved & n = 136 & R² = 0.476*** \\ 
Laboratory Development & Validation & Is the model reliable? & DISC-3 & Train-test cross-validation & Strong predictive accuracy & n = 95→41 & r = 0.79*** \\ 
Field Translation & Detection & Does the model work in wild populations? & FIELD-1 & Predicted vs. observed infection status & Successfully detects infection & n = 305 & +1.15\%*** \\ 
Field Translation & Discrimination & Can it distinguish parasite species? & FIELD-2 & Predicted loss by species identity & Species-specific responses & n = 169 & E.f: +2.06\%**, E.r: +1.25\%** \\ 
Field Translation & Scaling & Does it correlate with infection severity? & FIELD-3 & Predicted loss vs. parasite load & Scales with infection intensity & n = 185 & r = 0.233* \\ 
Biological Validation & Physiological relevance & Does it capture real health impacts? & PROOF-1 & Predicted loss vs. body condition & Correlates with actual body weight & n = 336 & ρ = -0.115* \\ 
Biological Validation & Specificity & Is the response Eimeria-specific? & PROOF-2 & Predicted loss vs. parasite community & Specific to Eimeria infections only & n = 305 & p < 0.001*** \\
